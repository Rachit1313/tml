# Contributing to tml - Text to HTML Converter

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Getting Started

### Installation for Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mnajibi/tml.git
cd tml
chmod +x main.py
```


### Development and Testing

Before sending a pull request, please make sure the following is done:

- Fork the repo and create your branch from main.
- If you've added code, add tests.
- Ensure your code works with the existing tests.
- Update the documentation if necessary.

When you're ready to create a pull request, be sure to:

+ Write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:
```bash
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
>
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```


### Submitting changes

Please send a GitHub Pull Request to tml with a clear list of what you've done (read more about pull requests). When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you include tests. We can always use more test coverage. Please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but larger changes should have a paragraph describing what changed and why.

### Reporting Bugs

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

Thank you for contributing to `tml`!
